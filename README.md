# Recette Desktop Application

Recette (from the french word 'une recette' => 'a recipe')
is an application for storing your own custom recipes and/or using pre-made recipes.

This is the Desktop application of Recette written in ElectronJS, a mobile app will come out (not) soon!

I guess you don't need any instruction to the app functionality.

### TODO:
- Make Application faster.
- Develop Flutter Mobile app.
- Add more recipes.
- Maybe change app name???
- Auto size selected recipe bootstrap cards.
- Not that life changing edits in Create Recipe function.
