# Recette Desktop Application

Recette (from the french word 'une recette' => 'a recipe')
is a desktop application for storing your own custom recipes and/or using pre-made ones.

This is the Desktop application of Recette written in ElectronJS, a mobile app will come out (not) soon!

I guess you don't need any instruction to the app functionalities.

### TODO:
- Make Application faster.
- Add more recipes.
- Maybe change app name???
- Changes for edit/create recipe function.
- Recipes with icons.
- Code mobile version with Flutter.
